# EDApplication
Embedded debugger PC application.

The Embedded Debugger is a C#/.NET tool which is used to debug embedded
systems at a high level. The tool has been developed at DEMCON and has been actively
used in many projects. This tool allows engineers to write to registers, read from, plot
and log values from registers. 

The PC application is developed by a intern at DEMCON. The application is not very stable at the moment.
The graduation report of the student can be found in ApplicationInformation.pdf

TODO:
- [ ] Make the application more stable.
- [ ] Make a doxygen output for the brances
- [ ] Auto compile after commit with Appveyor
- [ ] Re-add the parsing tab, this was removed because of the need of fromelf.exe from Keil. See if there is an open-source variant of this application
